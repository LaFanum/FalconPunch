I never tested this software on any other device before so i dont know if it will even run. But you'll need to have SFML installed. read below for building.

# Building FalconPunch

You'll need a few things:

* [Mingw32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw//)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Make sure you add MinGW to your environment variables!

Once you install these clone the source code and type 'cmd' in the root project folder.
After that run `build.bat`
