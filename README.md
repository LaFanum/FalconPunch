I never tested this software on any other device before so i dont know if it will even run. But you'll need to have SFML installed. read below for building.

The game now works for codeblocks due to the easier debugging.

# Building FalconPunch

You'll need a few things:

* [Mingw32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw//)
* [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/)
* [Code Blocks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/)

Make sure you add MinGW to your environment variables!

If you don't know how [Start Watching This](https://youtu.be/JsO58opI3SQ)

Once you install these clone the source code and type 'cmd' in the root project folder.
After that run 

```build.bat```

# IMPORTING CHARTS!!

How to import FNF charts it pretty simple.

First make sure you have the **Inst**, **Voices** and the chart file. then go to assets and replace the old charts and run the game!
